The project is related to Falaise simulations tutorial

To run simulation:
1. run ./main
2. choose isotope (its configuration is located in /sps/nemo/scratch/ktrofimi/Attempt/Isotopes_configurations), there are just four options : Se82_0nubb, Se82_2nubb, Bi214 or Tl208
3. choose number of events to simulate
4. choose the name of simulation folder
5. choose number of files

when simulations will be over, we can check efficiencies by running ./Analyze.sh:
1. run ./Analyze.sh
2. choose folder
3. choose number of files

now this script doesn't work because of libssl.so.10

and also: folder "whaa" contains simulations with new version of Falaise, so it should work
